ðŸ”· Project Title:
VidyAI++ - Multilingual AI Tutoring & Mentorship Platform for BPL Government School Students
ðŸ”· Selected Domain:
AIML
ðŸ”· Problem Statement / Use Case:
Build an AI-powered, multilingual, and inclusive education platform that offers adaptive tutoring and real-time mentorship for underprivileged (BPL) students in Indian government schools, addressing barriers like language diversity, low literacy, lack of teachers, and limited internet connectivity.
VidyAI++ is an innovative AI-powered tutoring and mentorship platform tailored for underprivileged students in government schools across India. This initiative aligns with the National Education Policy (NEP) and aims to provide personalized, accessible education in regional languages through a dynamic web platform.

The platform functions as a multilingual academic assistant, employing Generative AI (GPT/Gemini) to create localized content and quizzes in various Indian languages, available in both text and voice formats. It utilizes reinforcement learning to adapt lesson difficulty based on individual student performance, offering personalized interventions such as explainer videos and alternative teaching methods.

To enhance personalization further, the system incorporates webcam-based emotion and fatigue detection using OpenCV and DeepFace, which assesses the studentâ€™s cognitive load and adjusts pacing in real time. Additionally, an AI-powered mentor matchmaking module connects students with suitable mentors (volunteers/NGOs), taking into account emotional states, subject requirements, and mentor availability.

VidyAI++ also features a Persona Intelligence Engine that classifies students as visual, auditory, or kinesthetic learners, adapting content formats to suit their learning styles. The platform gamifies the learning experience through streaks, badges, skill heatmaps, and micro-certifications, fostering engagement and motivation.

Moreover, the offline-first Progressive Web App (PWA) architecture ensures functionality in low or no internet zones, while a zero-literacy interface allows access via voice commands and visual cues, making it inclusive for non-readers. This comprehensive approach aims to empower underprivileged students, providing them with the tools and support needed to succeed academically and beyond.
